# TODO-List
Some advanced features added


https://trimbak15.github.io/TODO-List/

1) This was the first Project as I come across to JS.
2) My work in this was that let the user should able to add the element in the todo list for it's entire day.
3) After he note down the thing as the day progress he can overline the thing that the user came across.
4) On next day he might delect that thing.
